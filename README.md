# toolchain-arm-linux-gnu

CRUX-ARM Toolchain using hard-float version of the "new" ABI (EABI), targeting
armv7 and up

> IMPORTANT NOTE:
>
> This toolchain is marked as obsolete and was developed using a CRUX system
> as a host whose version matches the version of CRUX-ARM to be generated.
> That is, to compile version 3.5 of this toolchain, you will need, ideally, a
> CRUX 3.5 host, otherwise it is very likely that you will get compilation errors, especially with recent compilers.
